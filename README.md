## Thought process behind the data story

- At the very first glance of the datasets, I knew I wanted to create some kind of team but I wasn't sure what to represent in my team.
- I initially wanted to create the `strongest` team to go into battle. But while doing so, I realized that would more or less be very generic and find out creating a team out of **balance** would be a very interesting way to go about it
- After all data manipulation and I finally was able to come up with a team, then I needed to find the story behind it which I eventually was able to come up with. (A long one ðŸ˜¬ but worth the read)

## Algorithms / libraries used to generate the visualization

- Python/Node.js
- React
- Chartjs
- react-chartsjs-2

I used python to do some cleaning of the data removing some unused columns and unknowns. After this, to come up with the team I had to do a couple of data manipulation to get the final selection I wanted to talk about.
react-chartsjs-2 is a react wrapper around Chartjs. Chartjs is a library that helps to make different types of charts from data. I used Pie chart and Bar chart in the application
